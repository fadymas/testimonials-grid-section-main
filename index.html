          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
          been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
          an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
          and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
          12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
          as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

          " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
          were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
          agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
          learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
          have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
          job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend! "
